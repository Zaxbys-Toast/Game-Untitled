# Game - Untitled

## Player Character

## Stats
- **HP**
- **MP**
- **Intelligence**
- **Wisdom**
- **Dex**
- **Strength**
- **Stamina**
- **Stealth**
- **Insanity** - Allows for access to certain builds. Can only be grown through contact with Eldritch items/creatures (progresses with the game, grows faster with occult items (for cultist class))

## Classes
Each major class level should have a “job” name from a real life job

### Farmer (gardener - reaper)
Default that every character starts as. 1 in each stat. Has shotgun that was used to protect the farm from vermin back before the event, but it doesn’t do much to the creatures of the forest… 

### Hunter (archer - predator)
“As you release the arrow from your bow, it feels like worms are crawling underneath your skin from your fingertips. They quickly reach your brain, you feel excruciating pain and yet also a sense of unbound freedom?” Kinda like a bandit/rogue class. Prioritizes dex and stealth. Gives +2 levels to each to start with. Gained through some hunting related feat. Maybe a mutated deer hunt. Should be easy to obtain, and scale well. Maybe not great mid game but very good late game as you grow more insane. You learn how to camouflage yourself as the very creatures you are hunting (delusions)

### Cultist (believer - pope)
Find an occult temple in the woods and make a sacrifice. Magic caster, grows insane more quickly, human settlements become hostile while any cult type equipment is equipped, special rewards for wiping out human settlements. While below a certain threshold of insanity you can “repent” and switch to a mage. High levels of insanity allows for access to late game occult spells. You can hold sacrificial rituals to create strong gear at your base. Higher insanity means you can attune more spells. Since insanity is so high and there aren’t too many other stats to raise there should be a drawback as you get to higher levels, maybe more powerful attacks damage the user as well?

### Mage (student - professor/keeper of knowledge)
Find a human settlement with a strange library. Inside should be a person who seems to be raving about crystals and says they'll reward you if you can bring them their rocks. Gain the class by giving them crystals (make it fulfillible by a rock too (funny)). Prioritizes intelligence and wisdom. Insanity stat becomes insight, you aren’t being driven mad but you can see the shadowy creatures that are driving people insane. High levels of insight allow access to late game spells. Bring back occult materials to study at your base to craft better staffs. Higher wisdom means you can attune more spells

### Knight (martial artist - stuff in between - martial artist)
Find a human settlement and volunteer to help defend the wall against a monster attack. Cut scene of you learning how to swing a sword and defending the wall a couple of times, making friends. One day the wall is breached, you can either run or stay and fight. If you run you watch your friends die from a distance as you start to go insane. Class skills lean towards darkness/insanity (fallen knight class). If you stay you barely stay alive, your friends still die, but now you are on a righteous crusade against the monsters. Light class skills, insanity becomes insight.

### Assassin/Thief (dancer)
Tied to classical dance. Find a human settlement where you can meet a performing dancer. Speak to them about their experiences in this new world and find out that the skills they have learned translate well to killing unseen. This has led to many unsavory jobs but they pay well and their employers keep them safe. Ask them to teach you how to do this and they will show you some basics, but you should seek out the larger “dancers” guild in the city to truly become an expert. This should be a mid-late game class upgrade. As you grow more and more insane you learn to dance between the lines of real and illusory, allowing you to become like the shadows, unseen by normal people and unnoticed by those who are truly strong.

# Enemies

## Early Game
Very early game, forest creatures who have gone crazy, starting to show signs of mutation
As you go deeper into the forest they are replaced by mutated creatures.

- **Boar** - Charges in a straight line with a slash at the end
- **Deer** - Runs away when the character is noticed but provide good meat and materials
- **Rabbit** - “                                                                                                      “

### Bosses
- **Mutated Stag** - casts low level nature magic
- **Mutated Boar** - stronger version of mob creature, has a bloodlust ability

## Mid Game
The mutated animals are beginning to change again, becoming something completely new… Intelligent enemies (like goblins) start to appear.

### Bosses

## Late Game
Eldritch creatures
Shadows of insanity (get stronger and more numerous with more insight/insanity)
Rename to delusions?

### Bosses
Enemies will be the same for all classes but evil class variants will get different dialogue, Bosses will accuse you of trying to steal their spot instead of shitting on you for trying to kill their god.

# Items

- **Swords (Knight and Hunter)** - Scale with strength and dex depending on the sword. One-handed and two-handed variants. Main weapon of the knight. One-handed can be useful to the hunter at times.
- **Shields (Knight)** - They’re shields. You can use them if you really want but I don’t want them to be too good.
- **Bows (Hunter and Dex Based Knight)** - Scale with dex and a little strength. Main weapon of the hunter along with daggers. Special arrows can be crafted, but the insight into these recipes is gained by hunters not knights. Supplemental for knights
- **Daggers (Cultist and Hunter and Melee Based Mage)** - Close range weapon for Hunter and magic classes. Swings fast but doesn’t deal much damage. Better with higher stealth and Dex
- **Staffs (Cultist and Mage)** - Main weapon, used for casting, casting takes time and MP. Better with higher intelligence.
- **Scrolls (Cultist and Mage)** - Single use items made for buffs and one time use spells that instant cast, drain MP
- **Hoes (Farmer weapons)** 
  - **Hoe** - A farming tool that is all but broken
  - **Hoe of the Forest** - Drops from the Mutated Deer
- **Scythes (Late game weapon for farmer)** - A reapers scythe - Death takes note of a kindred soul, killing as if you were reaping grain
- **Potions (All Class)** - Non-magic classes should seek out settlements for higher level/buff potions but all can make general purpose healing and mana restoration
- **Light Armor**
- **Medium Armor**
- **Heavy Armor**

# Base
Your farm land, develops in different directions based on your class. Where you will do crafting etc. Occasionally beasts will attack. If you leave it alone for too long it will start to be overrun and you’ll have to clear out beasts. Where you will level up. As you increase your level you will not be satisfied by food from normal sources anymore, hunting higher level animals and finding higher level plants will allow you to craft meals which can bring boosts and heal better.

# Locations

- **Forest**
- **Village/Encampment**
- **City**
